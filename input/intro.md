Hi, this is Alan, 周俊哲 :) I am an fourth-year Physics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chicago advised by Prof. Scott Dodelson. I work on cosmology, astrophysics, and statistical learning and inference. I use deep probabilistic models to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectory of our universe using large observational data sets. I like forward probabalistic modeling, differentiable algorithms, and finding patterns across low SNR data.

I am currently at [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu), I am part of the [Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics](https://kavlicosmo.uchicago.edu/) and the [SkAI Institute](https://skai-institute.org/) for artificial intelligence research. I did my first two years of Ph.D. at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/physics/), where I was a part of the [McWilliams Center for Cosmology](https://www.cmu.edu/cosmology/) and the [NSF AI Planning Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ai-physics-institute/). I graduated from Duke in 2022. Most of my works are done at the Perlmutter supercomputer at NERSC and the Bridges-2 supercomputer at the PSC. I am also supported by Jane Street as a [Jane Street Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/programs-and-events/grf-profiles-2024/).

## A short bio
I grew up in Beijing, China. I attended high school in [Pebble Beach CA](https://stevensonschool.org/) (after a short stay in Miami), went to [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) for undergrad, spent two years at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), and am currently at [UChciago](https://www.uchicago.edu). I enjoy exploring all the little corners of this world! Before working on cosmology, I researched at the Large Hadron Collider at [CERN](https://www.home.cern/) in Geneva, did classical archeology and early modern art history in Rome, studied at the [Duke Kunshan](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn/) campus near Shanghai, and was very interested in [QFT and nuclear theories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13780)! I was incredibly lucky to have met so many great mentors, who showed me how all these fields shared the same indelible human touch. I am really looking forward to sharing some of this journey here, and please bear with me as I figure out how this website works!
